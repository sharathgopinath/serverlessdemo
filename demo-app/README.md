# ServerlessDemo App

A simple Angular app and a Serverless Api backend with OAuth authentication using Auth0 (https://auth0.com/)

## Configuration
Configure Auth0, Api Url and other environment settings in src/app/environments/environment.ts. 
The compiled app could ideally be copied to an AWS S3 bucket (with static hosting enabled) to make it completely serverless
